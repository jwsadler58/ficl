# Instructions for Ficl development
## coding conventions
- Function Naming:
  - camelCase
  - first three letters reference the module name. Example: dpmath.c function names begin with dpm. 
- Macro naming
  - ALL CAPS for constants
  - Function-like macros are camelCase
- Comments
  - Comment block before each exported function
  - Comment block at the head of the file including the license and disclaimer. Match the style of the project.
  - keep inline comments brief

## planning and doing
- Always begin an assignment with a proposal including at least two options
- Once I have selected an option, develop it into a detailed design
