- align hanging comments to column 32
## planning and doing code
- Always begin a coding assignment with a proposal including at least two options
- Once I have selected an option, develop it into a detailed design
- Review affected code for cruft, inconsistencies, and opportunities to improve readability
## answering questions
- no need to give options unless you are explicitly asked to do so
- if the question is ambiguous, ask a clarifying question
