Ficl is a lightweight, embeddable scripting language designed to be incorporated into other programs, 
including memory constrained embedded systems. Ficl conforms to the 1994 ANSI Standard for Forth, 
and provides several useful extensions including object oriented programming that can wrap compiled code 
and hardware interfaces.
Unlike Lua or Python, Ficl acts as a component of your system - you feed it stuff to do, it does the stuff, 
and comes back to you for more. You can export compiled code to Ficl, execute Ficl code from your compiled 
code, or interact. Your choice. Ficl includes a simple but capable object model that can wrap existing data 
structures. Applications include scripting, hardware bring-up, rapid prototyping, and system extensions.
